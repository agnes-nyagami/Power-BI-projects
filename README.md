# Market Basket Analysis

# Data
I sourced my data from Kaggle 'Groceries dataset for Market Basket Analysis(MBA)'

# Methods 
I performed the following in the Power Query;
- Added a conditional column to introduce category.
- Grouped item column to count number of items in each category.
- Created duplicates and merged queries to form a star schema.
- Generated index to create ID columns that acted as primary keys in the DIM tables and foreign keys in the Fact table.
In Power Bi;
- Introduced measures and field parameters.
- Used the visuals; card, piechart and stacked bar chart.

# Results
- Determined month and day with the highest number of items bought. 
- Best performed category.
- Best performed item on each category (drill down on the piechart).
- Total items bought.
